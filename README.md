---

### 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Profiled customer counts, product categories, and order volumes
- Identified missing values, outliers, and normalization needs
- Ran sanity checks to ensure referential completeness

---

### 🔍 Data Analysis
- Top 5 products by revenue, most frequent customers by region
- Monthly sales and average order value trends
- Underperforming products and category contribution breakdown
